Below is a formal VERSIONING.md specification for the OPRMT™ Free Library repository.
This is a governance-grade version control doctrine — not a casual SemVer note.
Place at:
Copy code

/VERSIONING.md
VERSIONING.md
Repository: OPRMT™ Free Library
Framework: OPRMT™ (Objective, Parameters, Results, Method, Tools)
Owner: Michael W. Fleming
Website: https://oprmt.solutions
1. Versioning Authority
This repository operates under controlled Semantic Versioning (SemVer).
Version control applies to:
Repository releases
Prompt artifacts
Taxonomy registry
Compliance model
Schema definitions
Governance documents
Final version approval authority:
Michael W. Fleming
2. Version Format
All versions must follow:
Copy code

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Example:
Copy code

1.4.2
No prefixes inside files.
Git tags must use:
Copy code

vX.Y.Z
Example:
Copy code

v1.4.2
3. Repository-Level Versioning
Repository version is tracked through:
Git tags
CHANGELOG.md
Release commits
3.1 MAJOR (X.0.0)
Increment MAJOR when:
OPRMT™ structural format changes
Breaking taxonomy changes
Compliance model restructuring
License changes
Schema breaking changes
Governance model restructuring
Example:
Copy code

1.3.4 → 2.0.0
MAJOR updates may invalidate previous prompt compatibility.
3.2 MINOR (0.X.0)
Increment MINOR when:
New prompt modules are added
New categories added
Non-breaking schema extensions
Compliance scoring improvements
Automation hooks expanded
Example:
Copy code

1.3.4 → 1.4.0
MINOR updates must remain backward compatible.
3.3 PATCH (0.0.X)
Increment PATCH when:
Documentation corrections
Metadata corrections
Minor formatting updates
Non-functional improvements
Typo fixes
Clarification adjustments
Example:
Copy code

1.3.4 → 1.3.5
PATCH updates must never alter structure or logic.
4. Prompt-Level Versioning
Each prompt artifact must include versioning inside:
Copy code

## Metadata
Version: X.Y.Z
Prompt versions are independent of repository version.
4.1 Prompt MAJOR
Trigger when:
Objective changes materially
Output structure changes
Validation criteria altered
Deterministic level reduced
Core logic changed
4.2 Prompt MINOR
Trigger when:
Additional validation rules added
Optional tools added
Method improved without breaking structure
Clarifying expansion
4.3 Prompt PATCH
Trigger when:
Grammar corrected
Metadata updated
Formatting improved
Non-functional refinement
5. Schema Versioning
All JSON schema files must include:
Copy code
Json
"version": "X.Y.Z"
Breaking validation changes require MAJOR increment.
6. Taxonomy Versioning
The taxonomy registry must maintain its own version.
Triggers:
Change Type
Version Bump
New category
MINOR
Subcategory addition
MINOR
Category removal
MAJOR
Renaming
MAJOR
7. Compliance Model Versioning
Compliance model changes impact determinism scoring.
Change
Version
Weight adjustment
MINOR
New scoring dimension
MINOR
Removal of dimension
MAJOR
Passing score change
MINOR
8. Governance Document Versioning
Files requiring version metadata:
SECURITY.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
VERSIONING.md
CHANGELOG.md
Governance updates:
Structural change → MINOR
Enforcement rule shift → MAJOR
Clarification → PATCH
9. Release Process
Each official release must:
Increment repository version
Update CHANGELOG.md
Commit with:
Copy code

RELEASE: vX.Y.Z
Create Git tag:
Copy code

vX.Y.Z
Publish GitHub Release Notes
10. Pre-Release Identifiers (Optional)
Allowed format:
Copy code

1.2.0-alpha
1.2.0-beta
1.2.0-rc1
Pre-release builds must not be tagged as stable.
11. Deprecation Policy
When prompts or categories are deprecated:
Status must change to: deprecated
Replacement must be referenced
Deprecation date must be recorded
Removal requires next MAJOR release
12. Backward Compatibility Policy
Free Library policy:
MINOR and PATCH releases must preserve backward compatibility
Only MAJOR releases may break compatibility
Deprecated prompts remain until next MAJOR release
13. Determinism Stability Guarantee
If a prompt is marked:
Copy code

Status: stable
DeterministicLevel: 4+
It must not change behavior without MAJOR increment.
14. Version Audit Integrity
Prohibited:
Retroactive editing of release history
Silent version increments
Untracked structural changes
Modifying CHANGELOG after release tag
Violations invalidate release integrity.

16. Strategic Purpose
Versioning transforms the OPRMT™ Free Library from:
Static prompt collection
→ Managed structured system
→ Governed framework infrastructure
→ Compliance-validatable engineering asset
This supports:
Certification engines
SaaS validation
Enterprise integration
API distribution
Document Metadata
Document Version: 1.0.0
Effective Date: 2026-02-11
Repository Tier: Free Library
Next logical hardening layer:
RELEASE_PROCESS.md (detailed operational flow)
GOVERNANCE.md (formal authority doctrine)
GitHub Action validator YAML
Automated compliance scoring engine
Branch protection configuration policy
